## Installation

- You will need "utk_ornateprops" for this script to work with gold and diamond looting, you can turn it off in "client.lua",

- First add items in your database, you can find the relevant sql file in here,

- After sql make sure you have these scripts installed and working fine:

[ESX](https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended)

[mythic_notify](https://github.com/mythicrp/mythic_notify) IMPORTANT INFO: This file name must be "mythic_notify"

or

[pNotify](https://github.com/Nick78111/pNotify) IMPORTANT INFO: This file name must be "pNotify"

[progressBars](https://github.com/torpidity/progressBars/releases/tag/1.0) IMPORTANT INFO: This file name must be "progressBars"

- Then just copy "utk_ornateheist" and "utk_ornateprops" to you resources file and start them from "server.cfg", make sure to start "utk_ornateprops" before the "utk_ornateheist" just in case.

- If you want to use pNotify copy clientpNotify.lua and change its name to client.lua (THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!)

## Configuration

- There are a lot of comment lines inside the code for you to understand better, you can disable extraprops(gold, diamond) in "client.lua",

- In "server.lua" also comment lines for you to edit easily.
